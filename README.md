# AirQuality
A script made by me, that involves pulling data from the airly.com website and shoves it to a google sheet. 


<h1> What is this script? </h1> 
<h3> This is a python script that scraps data from <a href="https://airly.org/map/en/#33.89255,-84.835544,i90171"> airly.com </a> in the villa rica region and sends it to a public google sheets. </h3>

<h1> How does it work </h1>
<ul> 
  <li> First the user needs to download the folder in this repo to <strong> THEIR DESKTOP</strong>. This includes the pychace, dist, building, main.py, and main.spec. </li> 
  <li> The user needs to have an installation of google chrome for this program to work. If they do, then the program should work. If there is an error including the chromedriver, then most likely its the version of the driver. The current chrome driver is set at ChromeDriver 97.0.4692.71, to find other driver visit <a href="https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads"> here </a> </li>
  <li> The last step is to make sure they downloaded the file to their specifc OS. MacOS and Windows are not the same executable. Then go into your respectable OS folder and access the executable file named "main" in the ChromeDriver.</li> 
</ul>
